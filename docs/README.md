- Documentation reflects the **v1.9.0** codebase (Fairfax watersheds + stormwater overlays).
- Check `CHANGELOG.md` for feature history; use the tag that matches your running version if you are on an older release.

### Contributing to docs

1. Keep instructions executable against the repository as-is (no hypothetical steps).
2. Prefer concise callouts over repeating the same information in multiple guides.
3. Update version strings and cross-links when code changes introduce or remove features.
